Botkube allows you to execute `doctor` commands on your Kubernetes cluster. By default, `doctor` command execution is disabled. See the [**Enabling plugin**](../../configuration/executor/doctor.md#enabling-plugin) section from the `doctor` configuration documentation.

To execute the `doctor` commands, send message in following formats in the channel where Botkube is already added:

- Kubernetes native prompt:
  ```
  @Botkube doctor --namespace=[namespace] --resource=[resource] --error=[error]
  ```
- Free-form question:
  ```
  @Botkube doctor "[free-form question]"
  ```

By default, `chatgpt` is configured as alias for the `doctor` command. You can use them on par with the `doctor` command. To read more about aliases configuration, see the [Alias](../../configuration/alias.md) section.

This command needs to be executed from configured channel.
