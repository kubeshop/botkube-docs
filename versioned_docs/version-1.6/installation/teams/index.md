:::info

The previous Microsoft Teams integration has been deprecated. If you need to use the legacy Microsoft Teams integration, see the [Botkube 1.5 Documentation](https://969c27c7.botkube-docs-58l.pages.dev/1.5/installation/teams/). It is recommended to migrate to the new Microsoft Teams app per the below instructions.

:::

## Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams App

The Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams app offers several advanced features:

- Simplified installation into your Microsoft Teams workspace
- Multi-cluster executor support with a single Microsoft Teams app
- Manage Teams channels directly from the Botkube web app and ensure the Botkube bot is invited to the correct channels

The Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams app uses Botkube's cloud services to manage channels and route source events and executor commands. Currently, it requires a manual side-loading of the app, but we are working on getting it listed in Microsoft AppSource.

You can directly try Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams app for free by creating an account in the [Botkube Web App](https://app.botkube.io). Follow the steps below to install the app.

## Prerequisites

- A Botkube Cloud account.

## Using Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams App

You can start using Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams by typing `@Botkube cloud help` in one of the channels in the team you configured in one of the previous steps.

![Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams Command Help](assets/cloud_teams_command_help.png "Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams command help")

### Listing Cloud Instances

You can list all your Botkube Cloud instances by typing `@Botkube cloud list` in the Microsoft Teams channel, or click the button `List connected instances` in the help command response. Besides the instance `name`, `ID`, and `status` in the list response, you can also click the `Get details` button to go to instance details on Botkube Cloud Dashboard.

![Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams List Instances](assets/cloud_teams_list_instances.png "Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams list instances")

### Setting Default Instance

Once a Botkube command is executed, it will be handled on target Kubernetes cluster specified with `--cluster-name` flag. This is an optional flag,
where if you have not specified it, Botkube Cloud will select the first instance. However, you can also achieve setting default instance with command `@Botkube cloud set default-instance`.

![Cloud Microsoft Teams Set Default Instances](assets/cloud_teams_command_set_default.png "Cloud Microsoft Teams set default instance")

After this point, all of your commands will be executed on the default instance. Moreover, if you want to execute a command on all the target clusters, you can use `--all-clusters` flag.

## Cleanup

1. Go to Botkube Cloud instances page and click `Manage` button of the instance you want to remove.

   ![Cloud Teams Instance Manage](assets/cloud_teams_instance_list_manage.png "Cloud Microsoft Teams instances manage")

2. Click `Delete instance` button, type instance name in the popup and click `Delete instance`.

   :::caution
   Remember to execute the displayed command to completely remove Botkube and related resources from your cluster.

## Limitations

Botkube Cloud Microsoft Teams App currently doesn't support the following features yet:

- Processing states from selected dropdowns, e.g., used for the `kubectl` command builder. In a result, the command builder is not available.
- Adding ðŸ‘€ and âœ… reactions to messages indicating process status.

  This seems to be a limitation of the Microsoft Teams platform, however we'll investigate if there is a workaround.

- Sending messages visible only to specific users.
- Replacing messages with new content, e.g., used for pagination. Currently, a new card is sent as a new message.
- User mentions in messages. Instead, Botkube app uses plaintext mentions with first and last name.
- The `ChannelName` RBAC group mapping is not supported in Botkube Agent 1.6. This will be supported in the Botkube Agent 1.7 release.
