The communication settings contain:

- Configuration for communication platforms scoped in separate communication groups,
- Platform-specific options, such as multichannel configuration for platforms that support channels.

## Communication groups

Communication group is a way to aggregate separate configurations for a set of communication platforms. You can specify multiple communication groups, and, in a result, support multiple Slack or Mattermost workspaces, Discord servers, or Elasticsearch server instances.

Also, most platforms also support another level of multiple configurations within a workspace. For example, Slack supports multichannel configuration. To learn more about platform-specific options, see the [Syntax](#syntax) section.

:::note
The purpose of the communication group is to allow using multiple workspaces, e.g. for Slack or Mattermost. To use multiple channels inside the same workspace, don't define separate communication groups, but use `channels` property under a given communication platform instead.

### Example

Consider the following configuration:

```yaml
communications:
  "first-group": # Your own alias of a given communication group
    slack:
      enabled: true
      token: "{SLACK_TOKEN_1}" # Token for Botkube Slack app installed in Workspace 1
      channels:
        "general": # Your own alias for the channel configuration
          name: general
          bindings:
            executors: # Executors configuration for a given channel
              - k8s-default-tools
            sources: # Notification sources configuration for a given channel
              - k8s-events
        "random": # Your own alias for the channel configuration
          name: random
          bindings:
            executors: [] # Executors configuration for a given channel
            sources: # Notification sources configuration for a given channel
              - k8s-events
  "second-group": # Your own alias of a given communication group
    slack:
      enabled: true
      token: "{SLACK_TOKEN_2}" # Token for Botkube Slack app installed in Workspace 2
      channels:
        "primary-channel": # Your own alias for the channel configuration
          name: general
          notification:
            # If true, the notifications are not sent to the channel. They can be enabled with `@Botkube` command anytime.
            disabled: true
          bindings:
            executors: # Executors configuration for a given channel
              - k8s-default-tools
            sources: # Notification sources configuration for a given channel
              - k8s-events
```

The example YAML configuration definition results in the following configuration.

For Slack **Workspace 1**, as defined by the first communication group (`first-group`):

- Notifications from `k8s-events` source are sent to the `general` and `random` channels.
- Commands from the `k8s-default-tools` configuration can be executed in the `general` channel. On `random` channel executors are not configured.

For Slack **Workspace 2**, as defined by the second communication group (`second-group`):

- Notifications are configured to be sent from the `k8s-events` source to the `general` channel. They are disabled by default, and can be enabled with `@Botkube` command or during Botkube upgrade.
- Commands from the `k8s-default-tools` configuration can be executed in the `general` channel.

## Source and Executor Bindings

Most of the communication platforms support executor and source bindings, which allows fine-tuning the notifications and allowed Botkube commands inside a given channel.

With executor bindings you can configure which executors are allowed in a given channel. To read more about executor configuration, see the [Executor](../executor) document.

With source bindings, you can specify which events are sent to a given channel (or, in case of Elasticsearch, index). To read more about source configuration, see the [Source](../source) document.

## Known limitations

Currently, [Microsoft Teams](../../installation/teams/) integration works differently than other bot integrations, such as Slack or Discord. While Microsoft Teams support multiple channels for forwarding notifications, you need to turn them on with `@Botkube enable notifications` on each channel. Microsoft Teams uses source and executor bindings defined under `communications.teams.bindings` property for all channels in the following way:

- Executor bindings apply to all MS Teams channels where Botkube has access to.
- Source bindings apply to all channels which have notification turned on with `@Botkube enable notifications` command.

## Syntax

Each communication platform has specific options, however they share a similar syntax for consistency.
For example, bot integrations such as Slack, Mattermost or Discord have multichannel support, that is you can configure multiple channels with separate bindings. Same with Elasticsearch - you can forward notifications to multiple Elasticsearch indices, according to the sources configuration.
