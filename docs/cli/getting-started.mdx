# Getting Started

Botkube includes a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to interact with Botkube and Botkube Cloud from your terminal, or from a script.

## Installation

Select tab depending on the system you use:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="cli">
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS" default>

```shell
brew install kubeshop/botkube/botkube
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```shell
brew install kubeshop/botkube/botkube
```

<hr />

Alternatively, you can use `curl` to download the CLI binary:

```shell
curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube-linux-amd64
```

Copy the binary to the appropriate directory:

```shell
chmod +x botkube && mv botkube /usr/local/bin/botkube
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Use [`curl`](https://curl.se/windows/) to download the CLI binary:

```shell
curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube-windows-amd64.exe
```

Add it to the `%PATH%` environment variable.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual Download">

To manually install Botkube CLI:

1. Download the binary for the version and platform of your choice from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases). Alternately, run:

   ```shell
   export OS="" # allowed values: darwin, linux, windows
   export ARCH="" # allowed values: amd64, arm64, armv7
   #export SUFFIX=".exec" # uncomment if OS is `windows`
   curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube-${OS}-${ARCH}${SUFFIX}
   ```

2. Move it to a location in the PATH. For example:

   ```shell
   chmod +x botkube && mv botkube /usr/local/bin/botkube
   ```

   For Windows, you will need to add it to the `%PATH%`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## First use

For the commands that are nested under `cloud` command you first need to authenticate with Botkube cloud by running:

```bash
botkube login
```

If credentials are valid, the output is:

```shell
Login Succeeded
```

All available commands you can simply discover by running `botkube --help` or `botkube <command> -h` to see the help output which corresponds to a given command.

## Autocompletion

To learn how to enable autocompletion for your shell, run:

```bash
botkube completion --help
```

> **NOTE:** Be sure to **restart your shell** after installing autocompletion.

When you start typing a `botkube` command, press the `<tab>` character to show a list of available completions. Type `-<tab>` to show available flag completions.
