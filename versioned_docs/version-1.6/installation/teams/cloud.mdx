### Listing Cloud Instances

You can list all your Botkube Cloud instances by typing `@Botkube cloud list` in the MS Teams channel, or click the button `List connected instances` in the help command response.

### Setting Default Instance

Once a Botkube command is executed, it will be handled on target Kubernetes cluster specified with `--cluster-name` flag. This is an optional flag,
where if you have not specified it, Botkube Cloud will select the first instance. However, you can also achieve setting default instance with command `@Botkube cloud set default-instance`.

![Cloud MS Teams Set Default Instances](assets/cloud_teams_command_set_default.png "Cloud MS Teams set default instance")

After this point, all of your commands will be executed on the default instance. Moreover, if you want to execute a command on all the target clusters, you can use `--all-clusters` flag.
