This section aggregates all officially maintained Botkube plugins. Some of them require active [Botkube Cloud](https://app.botkube.io) account.

There are two types of the plugins:

- **Source plugins**, which emit events to the communication platforms,
- **Executor plugins**, responsible for handling commands from the supported chat platforms.

To learn how to build your own plugin, see the [Plugin development](./plugin-development/index.md) section.
