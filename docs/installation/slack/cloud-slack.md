The Botkube Cloud Slack App uses Botkube Cloud services to manage channels and route executor commands. This allows multi-cluster support without a need to create a dedicated Slack application for each cluster. Events and alerts are sent directly from your cluster to your Slack workspace for reliable, fast notifications.

## Prerequisites

- A Botkube Cloud account with active subscription.

  You can try out the Botkube Cloud Slack App for free by creating an account in the [Botkube Cloud app](https://app.botkube.io) and starting a free trial.

:::note
Once you downgrade your subscription to free, you will not be able to execute Botkube commands. However, you will still receive notifications from your clusters.

### Listing Cloud Instances

You can list all the Botkube Cloud instances by typing `@Botkube cloud list instances` in the Slack channel or click the button `List connected instances` in the help command response.
Besides the instance `name`, `ID`, and `status` in the list response, you can also click the `Get details` button to go to instance details on Botkube Cloud Dashboard.

### Setting Default Cloud Instances

Once a Botkube command is executed, it will be handled on target Kubernetes cluster specified with `--cluster-name` flag. However, this is an optional flag,
where if you have not specified it, Botkube Cloud will select the first instance. However, you can also achieve setting default instance with command `@Botkube cloud set default-instance {instance-id}`.

After this point, all of your commands will be executed on the default instance. Moreover, if you want to execute a command on all the target clusters, you can use `--all-clusters` flag.
