#### Adding a new documentation page

Create a Markdown file and place it under the `docs/` directory.
More info how to do it can be found in Docusaurus documentation [Create a doc](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc)

#### Modifying an existing documentation page

Find the documentation page file (`.md/mdx` file) under `docs/` and edit it.

### Publishing your changes

[Create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes. When the PR is merged site will be updated automatically. Make sure your pull request has [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ instead of _how_

Try to squash unimportant commits and rebase your changes on to the `main` branch, this will make sure we have clean log of changes.
