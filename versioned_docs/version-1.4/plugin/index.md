The Botkube plugin system allows you to extend the Botkube core with custom logic. For example, call or receive events from third-party services.

To learn more about the Botkube plugin system, follow the recommended steps:

- Get familiar with the Botkube [architecture](../architecture).
- Enable and configure the [Helm](../configuration/executor/helm.md) executor.
- Use the [template repository](./quick-start.md).
- Learn how to develop a custom [executor](custom-executor.md) or [source](custom-source.md) plugin.
- [Distribute the plugins](repository.md) that you built.
