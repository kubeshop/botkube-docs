The AI Assistant plugin makes it easier than ever for teams to identify, diagnose, and troubleshoot issues in any Kubernetes cluster. It is powered by the OpenAI's `GPT-4o` large language model with additional Kubernetes-related capabilities.

## Features

The plugin provides the following features:

- "AI Help" button for Kubernetes event analysis.
- Kubernetes cluster troubleshooting based on:
  - `kubectl` commands,
  - container logs,
  - Kubernetes events,
  - resource usage (CPU/memory).
- Kubernetes cluster scan.
- Answering arbitrary questions or instructions.
- Answering questions based on user-supplied documentation.
- Answering Botkube questions or instructions based on:
  - Agent status and configuration,
  - the latest Botkube documentation and other Botkube content.
- Keeping conversation context in the message threads.

## Get started

## Enable the plugin

Enable the plugin by adding [source](../self-hosted-configuration/source.md) and [executor](../self-hosted-configuration/executor.md) plugins to the Botkube configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  # ...
  ai-brain:
    botkubeExtraPlugins/ai-brain:
      displayName: "AI Brain"
      enabled: true
      context:
        rbac:
          group:
            type: Static
            static:
              values: ["botkube-plugins-default"]
      config:
        openAIAssistantID: "..." # OpenAI Assistant ID
        openAIAPIToken: "..." # OpenAI API Token
        # See the Configuration section for full config properties.

executors:
  # ...
  ai:
    botkubeExtraPlugins/ai:
      displayName: "AI"
      enabled: true
      context:
        rbac:
          group:
            type: Static
            static:
              values: ["botkube-plugins-default"]
      config:
        aiBrainSourceName: ai-brain # name of the source with ai-brain plugin

plugins:
  # ...
  repositories:
    botkubeExtraPlugins:
      url: https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube-plugins/releases/download/v1.14.0/plugins-index.yaml
```

Then, use the `ai` executor plugin in your [communication platform](../self-hosted-configuration/communication/index.md).

## Add the AI button to Kubernetes events

Optionally, you can add the AI button to your Kubernetes events by adding the following snippet to the [Kubernetes plugin](./kubernetes.md):

```yaml
extraButtons:
  - button:
      commandTpl: ai why the {{ .Kind | lower }} '{{ .Name }}'  in the {{ .Namespace }} namespace is failing with {{ .Reason }}. If possible, check the application logs.
      displayName: Ask AI
    enabled: true
    trigger:
      type:
        - error
```

## Usage

### Highlights

### AI Help for Kubernetes events

Click on the **AI Help** button to get an analysis of the event.

### AI questions and instructions

To ask the Botkube AI Assistant any question, use the `@Botkube ai` command prefix.

Here are a few examples to get you started:

- `@Botkube ai are my pods in default namespace up and running?`
- `@Botkube ai how many nodes are there?`
- `@Botkube ai output a yaml for Kubernetes pod with nginx image`
- `@Botkube what's the current Botkube status?`
- `@Botkube ai what's the difference between Botkube sources and executors?`
- `@Botkube ai what Botkube plugins are available to install? List all of them with one sentence description and link to the docs.`
- `@Botkube ai who's the Botkube maintainer?`

### AI cluster scan

The assistant can help you troubleshoot the Kubernetes cluster by performing a cluster-wide scan for any potential issues,
such as failing pods, high resource usage, security, RBAC, networking problems and misconfigurations, or any other anomalies.

To start the scan, use the `@Botkube ai scan` command. Based on the scan results you can ask follow-up questions, like `@Botkube ai how I can fix the missing network policy issue?`).

The AI scan is powered by the [Kubescape](https://kubescape.io/) and kubectl tools.

It has the following capabilities:

- aggregated cluster scan (prompt: `@Botkube ai scan`)
- container image scan (example prompt: `@Botkube ai scan the nginx:latest image`)
- workload scan (example prompt: `@Botkube ai scan the foo deployment`)
- [Kubescape control](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/controls) scan (example prompt: `@Botkube ai scan my cluster for the C-0009 control`; read more about the [C-0009 control](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/c-0009))

## Configuration

The `ai-brain` plugin supports the following configuration:

```yaml
openAIAssistantID: "..." # OpenAI Assistant ID
openAIAPIToken: "..." # OpenAI API Token
vectorStoreIDForThreads: "..." # Optional Vector Store ID for each thread. This allows file search capabilities for the AI plugin.
```

The `ai` executor doesn't expose any configuration options.

## Limitations

- The conversation context is stored in-memory and will be cleared on Botkube Agent restart.
