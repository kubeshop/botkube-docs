This document describes how to prepare and publish a new Botkube release.

## Prerequisites

- Proper permission on main `botkube` or `botkube-docs` repositories to trigger GitHub Actions.

## The `botkube` repository

:::info
Draft GitHub releases need to be manually checked and marked as pre-releases or published directly in the GitHub UI.
:::

### New minor or major release

1. Navigate to [**Cut a new release**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/cut-new-release.yml) workflow.
2. Click on **Run workflow** drop-down, fill **Version** field. (e.g. `v0.14.0`), and click **Run Workflow**.
   ![Botkube Release Cut](assets/release_cut_version.png "Botkube Release Cut")
3. It will generate all the needed artifacts and tag it with a release candidate tag, e.g. `v0.14.0-rc.1`.

   3.1. After final release candidate tests have been successful, continue to step 4.

   3.2. If bug is detected in the release candidate, create a pull-request with a bug fix against the release branch. Once the pull-request is merged, the [**Prepare next release candidate**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/next-rc.yml) workflow will be automatically triggered and a new release candidate will be published, e.g. `v0.14.0-rc.2`.

4. Navigate to [**Finalize release**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/finalize-release.yml) workflow and click on **Run workflow** drop-down and fill **Version** field to finalize specific release. (e.g. `v0.14.0`)

5. If you need to do the patch release after you executed the [**Finalize release**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/finalize-release.yml) workflow, go to [**New patch release**](#new-patch-release).

### New patch release

Let say that you have published `v0.15.0` release and detected a problem in this version. As an action item, you may want to create set of PRs
against a given release branch which is this case is `release-0.15`. After merging PRs to that release branch the [**Prepare next release candidate**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/next-rc.yml) workflow **won't be executed until you will not cut a new patch version** `v0.15.1`.

1. Navigate to [**Cut a new release**](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/actions/workflows/cut-new-release.yml) workflow.
2. Click on **Run workflow** drop-down and provide a patch release version like `v0.15.1`.

   By doing this, workflow will use `release-0.15` as base release branch which was already created in minor and major releases,
   and will introduce new release candidates on top of that like `v0.15.1-rc.1`.

3. Rest flow is the same as describe in 3rd point in [**New minor or major release**](#new-minor-or-major-release) section.

### What this automation does under the hood?

Let say that, our current production version is `v0.14.0` and we want to do another minor release which is `v0.15.0`. Once you apply
the release steps described above, it will perform following actions;

- Creates a release branch like `release-0.15` and pushes to remote
- Processes Helm Chart to update helm docs, tags it as `v0.15.0-rc.1` and pushes to remote
- Generates Docker images for Botkube core
- Builds Botkube plugins (sources and executors)
- Generates Botkube plugin index YAML file
- Generates changelog
- Creates draft release candidate with changelog body. Additionally, adds Botkube plugins binaries and index YAML as assets.
- Publishes Helm chart
- After release candidate verification and triggering **Finalize Release** workflow, it repeats steps 2,3,4,5 with `v0.15.0`

## The `botkube-docs` repository

### Release Steps

- Go to Botkube Docs [Actions page](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube-docs/actions), and click **Release workflow**
- Click **Run workflow** drop-down and fill the **Version** input for the next release, e.g. 0.14
  ![Botkube Docs Release](assets/docs_release.png "Botkube Docs Release")

  :::warning
  Don't use semantic version format, only provide Major and Minor fields of semantic version like `0.14`
  :::

### What this automation does under the hood?

- Generates a release branch like `release/0.14`
- Copies current documentation `./docs` to `./versioned_docs`,
- Updates `./versions.json` file,
- Creates new sidebar in `./versioned_sidebars`,
- Creates an automatic PR against `main` branch

### Archiving the older versions

Currently, archiving older versions is manual. To archive an older version, follow these steps:

- Remove the version from `versions.json`
- Remove all files under `versioned_docs/version-{version}`
- Remove sidebar file under `versioned_sidebars/version-{version}-sidebars.json`
- Add the version to `versions-archived.json` with a working link to the archived version.
