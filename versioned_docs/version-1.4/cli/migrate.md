## Migrating installation to Botkube Cloud

If you have started using Botkube with the Open Source installation, you have the option to migrate this instance to be managed using [Botkube Cloud](https://app.botkube.io/).

To make the migration process easier, we provide a dedicated `botkube cloud migrate` command that seamlessly transfers your Botkube installation to Botkube Cloud.

Supported Botkube platforms:

- Socket Slack
- Discord
- Mattermost

## Steps

1. [Install Botkube CLI](./getting-started.mdx#installation)
2. [Login into Botkube Cloud](./getting-started.mdx#first-use)
3. Run Botkube migrate:

   ```bash
   botkube cloud migrate
   ```

## Limitations

The following list contains current limitations that we will address in the near future:

- `extraObjects` in Botkube [helm configurations](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/blob/593746a70d9eb23469c28e5c0274c9a40a7b651d/helm/botkube/values.yaml#L1040) are ignored. If you have any extra resources under `extraObjects` section, you need to migrate them on your own.
- All 3rd-party plugins are ignored.
- Minimal supported Botkube version is v1.0.0.
