# Authentication with Botkube Cloud

Fuse is deeply integrated with Botkube Cloud. When you log in to Botkube Cloud, increased usage limits apply, and additional features are available.

## Benefits

### Increased usage limits

Once you log in to Botkube Cloud, you get **4x AI token usage limit** for your machine, regardless the free or paid plan.

### Additional features

While being logged in to your Botkube Cloud account, you can access the following features:

- [Knowledge documents upload](./knowledge-documents.md) (different limits apply for each plan),
- [Custom instructions](./custom-instructions.md).

All data for the features is shared between multiple memebers of your Botkube Cloud organization.

## Log in

To log in to your Botkube Cloud account, run:

```shell
botkube login
```

## Log out

To log out from your Botkube Cloud account and delete local authentication data, run:

```shell
botkube logout
```
