# Demo environment

To make it easier to try out Fuse, we provide a demo environment.

To use it, specify the `--with-demo-env` flag. By default, when running [`fuse tutorials`](./tutorials.md), you will be prompted if you want to use it as a part of the guided paths.

The flag configures access to our public read-only Google Cloud Platform project with a Kubernetes cluster. All read-only operations are allowed.
