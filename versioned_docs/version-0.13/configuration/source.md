The source settings contains:
- Resource list you want to watch,
- Namespaces you want to filter,
- The type of events you want to get notifications about,
- Settings to monitor updates for the specific resource fields,
- Ability to turn on/off specific recommendations per a given source.

Sources are bound to specific channels in the communications configuration. To learn more, read the [Source and Executor Bindings](./communication/#source-and-executor-bindings) section.

## Kubernetes resource events

A source essentially notifies a channel about events for configured resources filtered by specified namespaces.

### Merging strategy

When a channel binds to more than one source, the resource notifications are merged across all sources.

Let's say you have a resource defined in more than one source but wired with different events and namespaces.

```yaml
sources:
  'k8s-events':
    kubernetes:
      resources:
        - name: v1/configmaps
          namespaces:
            include:
              - (botk.*|default)
          events:
            - create
            - update
            - delete
  'k8s-updates':
    kubernetes:
      resources:
        - name: v1/configmaps
          namespaces:
            include:
              - botkube
          events:
            - update
```

The bound channel `monitor-config` (below) will notify on the merged events and namespaces across all resource/source definitions.

```yaml
communications:
  'default-group':
    slack:
      # ... trimmed ...
      channels:
        'monitor-config':
          name: "monitor-config"
          # ... trimmed ...
          bindings:
            # ... trimmed ...
            sources:
              - k8s-events
              - k8s-updates
...
```

Meaning, channel `monitor-config` will receive notifications for `v1/configmaps` events matching,
- the `botk.*|default` and `botkube` namespaces.
- the `create`, `delete` and `update` event types.

## Recommendations

For every source, you can configure recommendations related to Kubernetes resources. 

### Merging Strategy

Recommendations take a different approach from the [Kubernetes resource events merge strategy](#kubernetes-resource-events).

If multiple source bindings are specified for a given communication channel, the recommendations are merged with an override strategy. The order of bindings here is important, as it affects the final values of properties. The priority is given to the last binding specified on the list.

Consider the following example source configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  'first-source':
    kubernetes:
      # ... trimmed ...
      recommendations:
        pod:
          labelsSet: true
          noLatestImageTag: false
        ingress:
          backendServiceValid: false
  'second-source':
    kubernetes:
      # ... trimmed ...
      recommendations:
        pod:
          noLatestImageTag: true
        ingress:
          backendServiceValid: false
          tlsSecretValid: true
  'third-source':
    kubernetes:
      # ... trimmed ...
      recommendations:
        pod:
          noLatestImageTag: false
        ingress:
          backendServiceValid: true
```

And the following source bindings:

```yaml
communications:
    'default-group':
        slack:
            # ... trimmed ...
            channels:
                'random':
                    name: "random"
                    # ... trimmed ...
                    bindings:
                        # ... trimmed ...
                        sources:
                            - first-source
                            - second-source
                            - third-source
```

In a result, for the `random` channel, the merged recommendation configuration is as follows:

```yaml
recommendations:
    pod:
        noLatestImageTag: false # set in `first-source`, overriden in `third-source` with the same value
        labelsSet: true # set to `true` in `first-source`, other sources didn't specify its value
    ingress:
        backendServiceValid: true # set in `first-source` and `second-source` to `false`, overriden in `third-source` to `true`
        tlsSecretValid: true # set in `second-source`
```
