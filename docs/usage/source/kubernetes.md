Botkube allows you to consume `kubernetes` events on your Kubernetes cluster. By default, `kubernetes` plugin is disabled. See the [**Enabling plugin**](../../configuration/source/kubernetes#enabling-plugin) section from the `prometheus` configuration documentation.

Once it is enabled, Botkube Kubernetes plugin will consume Kubernetes events and send them to configured platforms as shown below.
