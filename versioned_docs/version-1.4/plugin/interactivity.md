Some of our communication platforms support interactive messages. If interactivity is supported the `IsInteractivitySupported` property under source or execution context is set to **true**.

In this guide, we describe how interactivity applies to messages, and show you how to build ones.

:::tip
For an example implementation, see the [`msg` executor source-code](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube-plugins-template/blob/main/cmd/msg/main.go).

## Primitives

You can construct and return interactive messages containing buttons, dropdowns, input text, and more complex formatting. For that reason, we introduced a generic `api.Messages` model.

- [Buttons](#buttons)
- [Dropdowns](#dropdowns)
- [Input text](#input-text-fields)

For all primitives you need to attach the proper command that will be executed by Botkube. The pattern is:

```go
import "github.com/kubeshop/botkube/pkg/api"

command :=  api.MessageBotNamePlaceholder + " <plugin_name>" + " <args>"
```

The `api.MessageBotNamePlaceholder` constant, is our cross-platform placeholder that is replaced by Botkube core with a proper bot name. It's mandatory, otherwise Botkube core will ignore a given command, e.g. a button click.

The `<plugin_name>` and `<args>` should be replaced based on your needs. You replace `<plugin_name>` with your own plugin name, or other plugin name, like `kubectl`, `helm`, etc. However, if you use other plugin name, a given command won't work if plugin is not enabled.

### Buttons

You can define a list of buttons under `Section` object. To construct a given button you can use our helper `api.NewMessageButtonBuilder` builder. For example:

```go
const pluginName = "msg"

btnBuilder := api.NewMessageButtonBuilder()

msg := api.Message{
	Sections: []api.Section{
		{
			Buttons: []api.Button{
				btnBuilder.ForCommandWithDescCmd("Run act1", fmt.Sprintf("%s buttons act1", pluginName)),
				btnBuilder.ForCommandWithDescCmd("Run act2", fmt.Sprintf("%s buttons act2", pluginName), api.ButtonStylePrimary),
				btnBuilder.ForCommandWithDescCmd("Run act3", fmt.Sprintf("%s buttons act3", pluginName), api.ButtonStyleDanger),
			},
		},
	},
}
```

When a button is clicked, Botkube runs an associated command. For **Run act1** it's `msg buttons act1`. If there is a plugin named `msg` and it is enabled on a given channel, it will be called by Botkube with a given command string. As a result, you can parse input command and return proper output.

If you use only `ForCommandWithoutDesc`, all buttons are render in the same line.

Otherwise, each button is rendered in new line with the description on the left side and button on the right side.

### Dropdowns

You can define dropdowns under `Section` object. You can split options into groups. Optionally, you can define the initial option. It must be included also under `OptionsGroups`.

```go
cmdPrefix := func(cmd string) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("%s %s %s", api.MessageBotNamePlaceholder, pluginName, cmd)
}

msg := api.Message{
	Sections: []api.Section{
		{
			Selects: api.Selects{
				ID: "select-id",
				Items: []api.Select{
					{
						Name:    "two-groups",
						Command: cmdPrefix("selects two-groups"),
						OptionGroups: []api.OptionGroup{
							{
								Name: cmdPrefix("selects two-groups/1"),
								Options: []api.OptionItem{
									{Name: "BAR", Value: "BAR"},
									{Name: "BAZ", Value: "BAZ"},
									{Name: "XYZ", Value: "XYZ"},
								},
							},
							{
								Name: cmdPrefix("selects two-groups/2"),
								Options: []api.OptionItem{
									{Name: "123", Value: "123"},
									{Name: "456", Value: "456"},
									{Name: "789", Value: "789"},
								},
							},
						},
						// MUST be defined also under OptionGroups.Options slice.
						InitialOption: &api.OptionItem{
							Name: "789", Value: "789",
						},
					},
				},
			},
		},
	},
}
```

When user select a given option, Botkube runs an associated command and appends selected option at the end. For **BAR** it's `msg selects two-gropus BAR`. If there is a plugin named `msg` and it is enabled on a given channel, it will be called by Botkube with a given command string. As a result, you can parse input command and return proper output.

### Input text fields

```go
msg := api.Message{
	PlaintextInputs: []api.LabelInput{
		{
			Command:          fmt.Sprintf("%s %s input-text", api.MessageBotNamePlaceholder, pluginName),
			DispatchedAction: api.DispatchInputActionOnEnter,
			Placeholder:      "String pattern to filter by",
			Text:             "Filter output",
		},
	},
}
```

When user types an input string and clicks enter, Botkube runs an associated command and appends input text in quotes. For example, for input **"text"** it's `msg input-text "test"`. If there is a plugin named `msg` and it is enabled on a given channel, it will be called by Botkube with a given command string. As a result, you can parse input command and return proper output.

## Message visibility

If the interactivity is enabled, you can change the default message visibility options:

- The `OnlyVisibleForYou` property allows you to display the message only to the user who clicked a given button or dropdown. It's taken into account only if respond to the interactive message. It cannot be used initial messages that are automatically sent to a given channel.
- The `ReplaceOriginalMessage` property allows you to replace the message which triggered interactive command. You cannot change `OnlyVisibleForYou` as the message retains its initial visibility.
