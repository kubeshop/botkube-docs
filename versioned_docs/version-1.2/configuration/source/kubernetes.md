A `kubernetes` source plugin produces events for configured Kubernetes resources. These events can be sent to communication channels or actions. To learn how to bind sources to communication channels or actions, read the Communication and Action documents.

## Enabling source

To enable Kubernetes source, add `--set 'sources.{configuration-name}.botkube/kubernetes.enabled=true'` to a given Botkube [`install` command](../../cli/commands/botkube_install.md).

## Event and resource constraints

Define constraints for Kubernetes events to narrow down the events you want to receive.

You can define both global constraints, that are applied to all resources within a given source, and also resource-specific constraints, which override global constraints. See the [Syntax](#syntax) paragraph for more details.

There are multiple types of constraints. Each constraint type is described in the following sections.

### Namespaces

Include and/or exclude namespaces to watch. You can use exact values or regex expressions to specify namespaces.

Exclude takes precedence over include. If a given namespace is excluded, it will be ignored, even if it included.

**Examples**

To watch all namespaces except those with `testing-` prefix, use the following constraint:

```yaml
namespaces:
  include:
    - ".*" # include all...
  exclude:
    - "testing-.*" # ...except any namespace that has `testing-` prefix
```

To watch only `dev` and `prod` namespaces, use the following constraint:

```yaml
namespaces:
  include:
    - "dev"
    - "prod"
  exclude: []
```

### Labels

Specify exact match for resource labels. The watched resources must have all the specified labels.

**Example**

```yaml
labels: # Match only the resources that have all the specified labels
  app: "my-app"
  environment: "production"
```

### Annotations

Specify exact match for resource annotations. The watched resources must have all the specified annotations.

**Example**

```yaml
annotations: # Match only the resources that have all the specified annotations.
  app: "my-app"
  my-annotation: "true"
```

### Resource name

Filter events based on the resource name. If not defined, all resource names are matched.
Exclude takes precedence over include. If a given resource name is excluded, it will be ignored, even if it included.

You can use both exact values and regex expressions to specify resource names. This constraint can be set per resource only. See the [Syntax](#syntax) paragraph for more details.

**Examples**

To match resource names that have `testing-` prefix, use the following constraint:

```yaml
name:
  include:
    - "testing-.*" # include only resource names that have `testing-` prefix
  exclude: []
```

To match all resources except those that have `testing-` prefix, use the following constraint:

```yaml
name:
  include:
    - ".*" # include all resource names...
  exclude:
    - "testing-.*" # ...except those that have `testing-` prefix
```

### Event types

List the event types to watch.

Possible values:

- `create`,
- `update`,
- `delete`,
- `error`,
- `all`, which is equal to all of the above.

**Example**

```yaml
event:
  types: # watch for create, delete and error events
    - create
    - delete
    - error
```

### Event reason

Define exact values or regex expression to match the event reason. If not defined, all events are watched.
Exclude takes precedence over include. If a given event reason is excluded, it will be ignored, even if it included.

**Examples**

To match events with reason equal to `BackOff`, use the following constraint:

```yaml
event:
  reason:
    include:
      - "^BackOff$" # match events with reason equal to `BackOff`
    exclude: []
```

To match all events except those with reason equal to `BackOff`, use the following constraint:

```yaml
event:
  reason:
    include:
      - ".*" # match all event reasons...
    exclude:
      - "^BackOff$" # ...except those equal to `BackOff`
```

### Event message

Define regex expression to match the event message. If not defined, all event messages are matched.

Exclude takes precedence over include. If a given event message is excluded, it will be ignored, even if it included.

**Example**

To match events with message starting with `Back-off`, use the following constraint:

```yaml
event:
  message:
    include:
      - "^Back-off.*" # match all events with message starting with `Back-off`
    exclude: []
```

To match all events except those with message starting with `Back-off`, use the following constraint:

```yaml
event:
  message:
    include:
      - ".*" # match all event messages...
    exclude:
      - "^Back-off.*" # ...except those starting with `Back-off`
```

### Recommendations

You can configure recommendations related to Kubernetes resources. Recommendations respect [namespaces](#namespaces) constraint regex patterns.

Currently, Kubernetes source plugin can send recommendation about 2 resources: `Pods` and `Ingresses`.

**Example**

In order to send recommendation for the Pods that have containers with `latest` tag or the Pods without labels, use the following configuration.

```yaml
recommendations:
  # Recommendations for Pod Kubernetes resource.
  pod:
    # If true, notifies about Pod containers that use `latest` tag for images.
    noLatestImageTag: true
    # If true, notifies about Pod resources created without labels.
    labelsSet: true
```

If you want to receive recommendations for Ingress that contains invalid backend service definition or TLS secret, use the following configuration.

```yaml
recommendations:
  # Recommendations for Ingress Kubernetes resource.
  ingress:
    # If true, notifies about Ingress resources with invalid backend service reference.
    backendServiceValid: true
    # If true, notifies about Ingress resources with invalid TLS secret reference.
    tlsSecretValid: true
```

### Filters

The filter configuration allows you to configure filters which are used for all processed Kubernetes events.

```yaml
# Filter settings for various sources.
# Currently, all filters are globally enabled or disabled.
# You can enable or disable filters with `@Botkube filters` commands.
filters:
  kubernetes:
    # If true, enables support for `botkube.io/disable` resource annotations.
    objectAnnotationChecker: true
    # If true, filters out Node-related events that are not important.
    nodeEventsChecker: true
```

## Syntax

```yaml
# Map of sources. Source contains configuration for Kubernetes events and sending recommendations.
# The property name under `sources` object is an alias for a given configuration. You can define multiple sources configuration with different names.
# Key name is used as a binding reference.
