## Prerequisites

- Botkube CLI installed according to the [Getting Started guide](../../cli/getting-started.mdx#installation)
- Access to Kubernetes cluster

## Install Botkube to the Mattermost team

Follow the steps below to install Botkube in your Mattermost Team (v5.14.0).

### 1. Enable Personal Access Token

Login with System Admin account, and in the Menu proceed to **System console > Integrations > Integration Management** and enable **Personal Access Token**.

### 2. Create Botkube user

To create a Botkube user, if not already created, proceed to the menu and Get a team invite link. Logout from the admin account and paste the link in the address bar and create a user with the username **Botkube**.

:::note
You can also use a custom username for your bot. However, it needs to be passed during Botkube installation in one of the further steps.
:::

Export the bot name as an environment variable:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_BOT_NAME="{bot_name}"
```

![mm_botkube_token](assets/mm_botkube_token.png)

Export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_TOKEN="{token}"
```

### 5. Add Botkube to a channel

Add Botkube user created to the channel you want to receive notifications in.

Export the channel name as an environment variable:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_CHANNEL="{channel_name}"
```

## Install Botkube in Kubernetes cluster

To deploy Botkube agent in your cluster, run:

```bash
export MATTERMOST_SERVER_URL={mattermost_server_url}
export MATTERMOST_TEAM={mattermost_team_name}
export CLUSTER_NAME={cluster_name}
export ALLOW_KUBECTL={allow_kubectl}
export ALLOW_HELM={allow_helm}

botkube install --version v1.3.0 \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.enabled=true \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.url=${MATTERMOST_SERVER_URL} \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.token=${MATTERMOST_TOKEN} \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.team=${MATTERMOST_TEAM} \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.channels.default.name=${MATTERMOST_CHANNEL} \
--set communications.default-group.mattermost.botName=${MATTERMOST_BOT_NAME} \
--set settings.clusterName=${CLUSTER_NAME} \
--set 'executors.k8s-default-tools.botkube/kubectl.enabled'=${ALLOW_KUBECTL} \
--set 'executors.k8s-default-tools.botkube/helm.enabled'=${ALLOW_HELM}
```

where:

- **MATTERMOST_SERVER_URL** is the URL (including http/https schema) where Mattermost is running,
- **MATTERMOST_TOKEN** is the Token received by creating Personal Access Token for Botkube user,
- **MATTERMOST_TEAM** is the Team name where Botkube is added,
- **MATTERMOST_CHANNEL** is the Channel name where Botkube is added and used for communication,
- **MATTERMOST_BOT_NAME** is the Mattermost bot username (usually it is `Botkube`),
- **CLUSTER_NAME** is the cluster name set in the incoming messages,
- **ALLOW_KUBECTL** set true to allow `kubectl` command execution by Botkube on the cluster,
- **ALLOW_HELM** set true to allow `helm` command execution by Botkube on the cluster,

Configuration syntax is explained [here](../../configuration).
All possible installation parameters are documented [here](../../configuration/helm-chart-parameters).

Send `@Botkube ping` in the channel to see if Botkube is running and responding.

## Remove Botkube from Mattermost Team

- Deactivate or remove Botkube user from Mattermost Team. Login as System Admin, in the Menu proceed to System console -> Users -> botkube -> Deactivate.
- Archive Channel created for Botkube communication if required.

## Remove Botkube from Kubernetes cluster

Execute the following command to completely remove Botkube and related resources from your cluster:

```bash
botkube uninstall
```
