## What problem does it solve?

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, DevOps, SRE, and platform engineers constantly juggle multiple tasks‚Äîfrom navigating through various layers of a project while implementing new functionalities to answering developer questions and troubleshooting infrastructure issues. This constant context switching often leads to inefficiencies and burnout.

We designed Fuse to solve the context switching problem for engineers that work with infrastructure, pipelines, and services.

## How it works?

Fuse categorizes your queries and applies custom AI assistant instructions for accurate responses.

During AI processing phase, Fuse integrates with your locally installed tools, with full control over the process.

Available capabilities:

- Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`),
- Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`),
- GitHub CLI (`gh`),
- Git,
- Python (arbitrary code execution),
- Filesystem operations,
- and more!

## Featured scenarios

We believe that even the most powerful AI assistants out there still require some guidance. Someone needs to do the ‚Äúprompt engineering‚Äù work. That‚Äôs why we introduced AI assistant guidance for different user scenarios. Currently, we focused on:

- GitHub Actions secret management,
- GitHub Actions pipeline run analysis,
- GKE troubleshooting with IAM permission errors,
- Local environment operations and debugging.

See the [Looking for inspiration](./usage.md#looking-for-inspiration) section to learn how to check out the scenarios.
