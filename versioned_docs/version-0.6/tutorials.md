# Tutorials

To browse available example use-cases, Run `fuse tutorials` in your terminal.

Tutorials command contains guided paths to get started with Fuse. Simply select one of the scenarios, like "Getting summary of CI/CD pipeline runs", and pick one of the prompts.

As a part of the tutorials, you can configure optional access to the [Demo environment](./demo-environment.md).

## Featured scenarios

We believe that even the most powerful AI assistants out there still require some guidance. Someone needs to do the “prompt engineering” work. That’s why we introduced AI assistant guidance for different user scenarios. Currently, we focused on:

- GitHub Actions secret management,
- GitHub Actions pipeline run analysis,
- GKE troubleshooting with IAM permission errors,
- Local environment operations and debugging.

You can see the video recordings of the scenarios on the [official landing page](https://botkube.io/fuse).
