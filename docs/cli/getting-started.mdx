# Getting Started

Botkube includes a command-line interface (CLI) that you can use to interact with Botkube and Botkube Cloud from your terminal, or from a script.

## Installation

Select tab depending on the system you use:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="cli">
<TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS" default>

```shell
curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube_darwin_amd64
```

Copy to binary directory:

```shell
chmod +x botkube && mv botkube /usr/local/bin/botkube
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```shell
curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube_linux_amd64
```

Copy to binary directory:

```shell
chmod +x botkube && mv botkube /usr/local/bin/botkube
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```shell
curl -Lo botkube https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases/download/v1.1.1/botkube_windows_amd64.exe
```

For Windows, you will add it to the `%PATH%`.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual" label="Manual Download">

To manually install Botkube CLI:

1. Download the binary for the version and platform of your choice from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/kubeshop/botkube/releases).
2. Move it to a location in the PATH. For example:

   ```shell
   mv botkube_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/botkube
   ```

   For Windows, you will need to add it to the `%PATH%`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## First use

For the commands that are nested under `cloud` command you first need to authenticate with Botkube cloud by running:

```bash
botkube login
```

If credentials are valid, the output is:

```shell
Login Succeeded
```

All available commands you can simply discover by running `botkube --help` or `botkube <command> -h` to see the help output which corresponds to a given command.

## Autocompletion

To learn how to enable autocompletion for your shell, run:

```bash
botkube completion --help
```

> **NOTE:** Be sure to **restart your shell** after installing autocompletion.

When you start typing a `botkube` command, press the `<tab>` character to show a list of available completions. Type `-<tab>` to show available flag completions.
