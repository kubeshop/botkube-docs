# Knowledge documents

Make Fuse even smarter by uploading your documentation. For example: architectural documents, onboarding material, runbooks, post-mortems, etc.

The user-supplied documentation is scoped to a given Botkube Cloud organization.

Both free and paid plans support this feature, with separate limits.

## Manage uploaded files

To manage the files, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the [Botkube Cloud dashboard](https://app.botkube.io)
2. Click on the **Fuse CLI** tab.
3. Under the **Customize Fuse Installations** section, find the **Knowledge Documents** card.

Upload new files with the **Upload file(s)** button.

To delete files, select the file(s) you want to delete and click **Delete selected file(s)**.
